# SDL 2D Engine in C
This is a simple 2D engine written in C using the SDL Library + OpenGL that I plan to use for a project
later. I don't plan to add significant support for things such as textures
and normal maps as the project that necessitates this only needs the ability for pixels
to be drawn to the screen and for sound to be played efficiently.

## Completed Portions
- Most of the boilerplate code and it can render simple sets of verticies to the screen

## In Progress
- Need to add Sound Support.
- Need to add routines to draw individual pixels efficiently to the screen.
